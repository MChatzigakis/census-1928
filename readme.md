# Interactive Maps of the 1928 Census of Greece

## Scope of Project

This repository contains source code and data used to produce two interactive maps at the i.) municipality level and ii.) province level that visualize the 1928 Census of Greece. These maps are part of [**Anatolia Imprints**](https://anatolia.int.webjar.gr/research), a research project that delves into the consequences of the colossal influx of more than 1.5 million Greek Orthodox refugees (who arrived between 1920 and 1923 from Asia Minor, Eastern Thrace, Cappadocia, Pontus, Caucasus, Bulgaria, Russia and other parts of the disintegrating Ottoman Empire) to the Greek economy as a result of The Balkan Wars and The Great War using big data (e.g., digitized 1928 Census of Greece) and a plethora of tools of economic science.

## Structure of Repository

The corresponding folders for the two maps are:
  
  -   The folder [mun]() which contains the source code and the required census and the geospatial data to produce the interactive map at the municipality level.
-   The folder [prov]() that contains the source code and the required census and the geospatial data to produce the interactive map at the province level.

## Code

- The maps were developed in R version 4.2.2.
- The file `libraries.R` contains the packages required to run the code.

## Data

The datasets in this repository are a byproduct of the digitization of the 1928 Census of Greece. More information about the data can be found [**here**](https://anatolia.int.webjar.gr).
